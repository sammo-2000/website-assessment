                <p class="pad">All students and staff of the College are entitled to register as members of the Learning
                    Resources
                    and to use the facilities of the Learning Resources for the purpose of their course of study or
                    College employment.</p>
                <p class="pad">Membership may also be extended to other individuals and to persons nominated from other
                    organisations: a fee is usually charged. Access to the Learning Resources for study purposes may be
                    made available to non-members by arrangement. Details are available in the External Services
                    leaflet.</p>

                    printed
                    below. These are designed to protect the interests of all users of Learning Resources and to ensure
                    that the College operates within the law and can carry out its functions efficiently and
                    effectively. The Learning Resources rules apply in principle to all Learning Resources sites,
                    including workstation rooms and site libraries, notwithstanding some variations in practice in the
                    site libraries. Admission to the Learning Resources is conditional upon observation of the rules and
                    the staff of the Learning Resources are empowered to enforce them.</p>
                <p class="pad">Breaches of the rules may be dealt with by specific Learning Resources Disciplinary
                    Action (see
                    below), including the withdrawal of some or all Learning Resources facilities, and if appropriate by
                    invoking the College’s Regulations for Students, in the case of students, or in the case of staff
                    through the appropriate College procedures as set out in the Staff Handbook.</p>
